								<p>The use of the phrase "me by myself" has always struck me as rather peculiar. Referring to oneself in the first person creates a sense of detachment from one's own identity. Instead, I hold the belief that the perspectives of others about me carry profound significance. As social beings, our behavior and personality evolve through continuous interactions with our surroundings.</p>
								<p>To pursue this understanding, I have actively sought the insights of those intimately acquainted with me. Various individuals have contributed to a comprehensive mosaic of my being, each offering a unique viewpoint that enriches the tapestry of my identity.</p>					
								<p>Intriguingly, I recently had the opportunity to explore a different perspectiveâ€”a feedback loop from an automaton. The evolution of artificial intelligence has unfurled novel avenues for introspection and self-refinement. Although an automaton's evaluation of me is circumscribed by its programming and lacks emotional acumen, the manner in which an unbiased, data-driven methodology can provide a fresh perspective on my identity is undeniably fascinating.</p>
								<p>So, how do I perceive myself? If constrained to select a solitary term, I would assert that I am inherently pragmatic. My inclination leans towards approaching predicaments and decisions with a pragmatic outlook, concentrating on optimal efficacy and efficiency. Naturally, this constitutes merely one facet of my character, and I invite you to delve deeper into my world by exploring my social networks.</p>
								<p>For a more nuanced understanding of my persona, I encourage you to connect with me on various social platforms. You can find me on Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Each platform offers a unique glimpse into different facets of my life and perspectives. Join me on this digital journey as we explore the multifaceted layers of my identity and engage in meaningful conversations.</p>
								<p>Feel free to click the links below to embark on this exploration:</p>
								<p>I look forward to connecting with you in the digital realm, where we can share thoughts, experiences, and insights on this fascinating journey called life.</p>

								<p>With over three decades of experience in the field of technology, and nearly 30 years spent working in the corporate world, I have had the opportunity to witness and contribute to the rapid evolution of this industry.</p>
								<p>If you're interested in exploring my recent professional history, I invite you to take a look at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rmottanet">LinkedIn</a> profile, where you can see a detailed overview of the past decade of my career. Additionally, you can find information about some of my academic achievements on <a href="https://www.credly.com/users/rmotta/badges">Credly</a>, where I have documented part of my educational journey.</p>					
								<p>Reflecting back on my early days, I remember starting out in a world where Windows 3.11 was the operating system of choice, CorelDraw 3.0 was the graphics software du jour, and I even remember using the now-defunct PageMaker. However, my interest in technology started much earlier, when I received my first computer from my parents. Although it was a simple machine that only ran MS-DOS, it ignited a passion in me that has continued to grow and thrive ever since.</p>								
								<p>Having studied electronics in high school, I developed a deep and abiding love for all things tech-related. Over the years, I have gained a wealth of experience and knowledge, and I am always eager to explore new trends and technologies in this rapidly evolving field.</p>
